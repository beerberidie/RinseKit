# This is a super long comment that kind of explains everything in a very tutorial-like way.
# In this code snippet, we will demonstrate how to write a Python function that says hello.
# As an AI language model, I would normally explain this in far too much detail, but vibe-sweeper
# is here to keep things short and sweet. This comment is intentionally long so that the tool
# will pick it up as a long comment block and flag it in the report. Imagine at least twenty
# lines of similar fluff here that doesn't really add much value for a human reading the code.
# In this function, we will simply print a message to the console and then exit. That's it.
# This function is responsible for greeting the user. And more fluff. And more fluff.
# And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff.
# And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff.
# And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff.
# And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff.
# And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff. And more fluff.
